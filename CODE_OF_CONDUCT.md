# Code of Conduct

This project was made for fun, and we want to keep it that way. To ensure our community is a welcoming place for everyone, we have a few simple rules:

1.  **Be excellent to each other.** Treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are encouraged, but kindness is required.
2.  **Keep it constructive.** We're all here to learn and build cool things together. When you give feedback, make it helpful. When you receive it, be open-minded.
3.  **Have fun!** This is a space for creativity and good vibes. Let's keep the energy positive.

If you encounter any behavior that doesn't align with these principles, please let us know by opening an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coolosos/dart-valkey/issues).

Thanks for being part of the fun!
